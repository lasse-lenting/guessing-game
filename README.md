# guessing-game
A simple CLI-based guessing game where I show how and what I'm learning with Rust.

## TO-DO:
* [x] Take in guess and parse it as `u32`  
* [x] Match guess and check if it smaller, larger or equal to the secret number  
* [x] If secret number is entered as guess, quit the game  
* [x] Randomly generate a secret guess when program compiles  
* [x] Define a set number of tries. If user maxes out tries, quit the game  
* [x] When a guess is sumbitted, display remaining amount of tries as well as total amount  
* [x] Quit game if user types `quit`, `stop`, or `exit`, or similar keywords as a guess  
* [x] If `reset` is entered as a guess, reset the number of tries to `0`  
[x] Set a max number of resets
